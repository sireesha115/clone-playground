# 🛠️ Clone-Playground

Welcome to my collection of website and app clones!  
This repo is all about practicing front-end and full-stack skills by rebuilding popular platforms.

## 🔄 What’s Inside?
Clones of:
- 🎧 Spotify
- 🛍️ Ajio
- 💸 Razorpay (coming soon)  
- 💬 Discord (maybe?) 
- And more!

## 🚀 Why Clones?
- Practice real-world UI/UX
- Improve HTML, CSS, JS & React skills
- Try out animations, layouts, and responsiveness
- Just for fun and learning!

## 📁 Structure
Each project is in its own folder with separate code.

## ⚠️ Note
These are for educational purposes only.  
I don’t own any original designs or logos — just rebuilding them to learn better.

Let’s keep building! 💻✨
Thank you for stopping 👋 ..Happy coding 🚀!
